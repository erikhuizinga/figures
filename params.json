  "body": "# `figures`: a MATLAB function to create multiple figure windows\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n`figures` is an extension to MATLAB's built-in [`figure`](http://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/figure.html) command. `figures` supports all the syntax options of `figure`. Hence, it is highly compatible with most, if not all of your existing MATLAB files. The syntaxes below are the extended possibilities provided by `figures`.\r\n\r\n## Demonstration\r\nRun `figuresdemo` for a demonstration of the possibilities of `figures`.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n - `figures` does the same as the `figure` command; it creates a new figure window.\r\n - `figures(n)` creates `n` figures in ascending order. Any currently existing figure windows are not replaced. Instead, the lowest available numbers are used to create the figure windows. For example, when figure 2 and 3 already exist, a call to `figures(2)` creates figure 1 and 4. `n` must be a scalar positive integer.\r\n - `figures(N)` activates the figure windows with the numbers in vector `N`. Any non-existent figure windows are created. `N` must be a vector of positive integers.\r\n - `figures(__,'PropertyName',propertyvalue,...)` uses the specified property values for all created or activated figure windows.\r\n - `figures(__,C)` uses the specified property values in cell `C` for each created or activated figure window. Construct `C` using the following syntax: `C = {{set1}, ..., {setN}}`, where each set is any number of `'PropertyName',propertyvalue` pairs.\r\n - `F = figures(__)` also returns `F`, a column vector of handle(s) to the created or activated figure window(s) in descending order. This order is the same as MATLAB's built-in list of currently existing figure windows from `get(0,'Children')`. The order reflects the latest activated figure window.\r\n",
